# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Game developed using Java language
* importing java.util.random
* while loop
* if, else if conditions
* passing values

# How the game works
* There are 2 players playing Rock, Paper and Scissor
1. The user   2. The Computer
* There are as many rounds you input i.e. wish to play in total 
* You win the entire game if you win half or more rounds else its the computers victory
* For every round that has a tie 0 marks are allotted
* So there could be a TIE too 

# Any new suggestions to make the game interactive and lively would be great
* You could use new data structures and algorithms
* You could add twists to this game
* ASCII drawings, speech recognition could be added etc
* You can make pull rquests to the readme and code both
